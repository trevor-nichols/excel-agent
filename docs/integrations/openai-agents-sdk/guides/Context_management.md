# Context management

Context is an overloaded term. There are two main classes of context you might care about:

1.  **Local context** that your code can access during a run: dependencies or data needed by tools, callbacks like `onHandoff`, and lifecycle hooks.
2.  **Agent/LLM context** that the language model can see when generating a response.

## Local context

Local context is represented by the `RunContext<T>` type. You create any object to hold your state or dependencies and pass it to `Runner.run()`. All tool calls and hooks receive a `RunContext` wrapper so they can read from or modify that object.

### Local context example

```typescript
import { Agent, run, RunContext, tool } from '@openai/agents';
import { z } from 'zod';

interface UserInfo {
  name: string;
  uid: number;
}

const fetchUserAge = tool({
  name: 'fetch_user_age',
  description: 'Return the age of the current user',
  parameters: z.object({}),
  execute: async (
    _args,
    runContext?: RunContext<UserInfo>,
  ): Promise<string> => {
    return `User ${runContext?.context.name} is 47 years old`;
  },
});

async function main() {
  const userInfo: UserInfo = { name: 'John', uid: 123 };

  const agent = new Agent<UserInfo>({
    name: 'Assistant',
    tools: [fetchUserAge],
  });

  const result = await run(agent, 'What is the age of the user?', {
    context: userInfo,
  });

  console.log(result.finalOutput);
  // The user John is 47 years old.
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

Every agent, tool and hook participating in a single run must use the same type of context.

Use local context for things like:

*   Data about the run (user name, IDs, etc.)
*   Dependencies such as loggers or data fetchers
*   Helper functions

> **Note**
>
> The context object is not sent to the LLM. It is purely local and you can read from or write to it freely.

## Agent/LLM context

When the LLM is called, the only data it can see comes from the conversation history. To make additional information available you have a few options:

*   Add it to the Agent instructions – also known as a system or developer message. This can be a static string or a function that receives the context and returns a string.
*   Include it in the input when calling `Runner.run()`. This is similar to the instructions technique but lets you place the message lower in the chain of command.
*   Expose it via function tools so the LLM can fetch data on demand.
*   Use retrieval or web search tools to ground responses in relevant data from files, databases, or the web.
